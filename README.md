### **_Description_**

The MVP form of this application will function as a simple crowdsourced public restroom locator. It will be the Wikipedia of public restrooms.

When a user is in need of a public restroom, they will be able to access the database in list form and filter by city and rating. If a listing is perceived as inaccurate, users will be able to update or delete the listing.

A post MVP version sees user authentication and a social media layer on top of the current idea.

### Intended Crud Functionality

- Create - user can create listing
- Read - user can view listings
- Update - user can add additional photos/reviews/ratings
- Delete - user can delete listings

### **_Technologies Used_**

- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
