### **_Description_**

The MVP form of this application will function as a simple crowdsourced public restroom locator. It will be the Wikipedia of public restrooms.

When a user is in need of a public restroom, they will be able to access the database in list form and filter by city and rating. If a listing is perceived as inaccurate, users will be able to update or delete the listing.

Upon first load, the user will be directed to a landing page at which they must enter their information. If the user already exists (until authentication is a viable option) their unique ID will be stored to credit them if they make contributions. (?)

A post MVP version sees a social media layer on top of the current idea. Obviously this much freedom by a pseudo-anonymous user would ill advised in a production setting.
